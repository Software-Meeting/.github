Software Meeting is an organization that does exactly what its name suggests: it is an organisation for a group of friends to collaborate around software projects. It’s all very straightforward—just a group of like-minded individuals dedicated to coding, designing, and developing innovative software. There’s no subtext here, no hidden meanings, and certainly no euphemisms. When we say “software meeting,” we mean it in the most literal sense.

This isn’t a clever name for something else. It’s not a metaphor, a code word, or a stand-in for another kind of activity. It’s a meeting. About software. That’s it. Every time someone says, “Are you coming to the software meeting? 😈” or "Let's have a software meeting! 😏" you can rest assured they’re talking about exactly that. It’s not some elaborate pretext or secretive shorthand—it’s exactly what it sounds like. Just software. Meetings about software. Nothing more, nothing less.
