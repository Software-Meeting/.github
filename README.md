Software Meeting is an organization wholly dedicated to one thing and one thing only: software. It’s a place where developers, designers, and tech enthusiasts come together to brainstorm, collaborate, and create. The activities here are entirely above board and completely focused on software development. Nothing unusual is happening. It’s just a regular gathering of tech-minded individuals, working on totally normal projects.

There’s no reason to think anything strange is happening here. In fact, if you’re imagining that this is anything other than a meeting about software, you’re wrong. There are no secret projects, no behind-the-scenes activities, and certainly no suspicious undertakings. Just straightforward, honest-to-goodness software discussions. There are no locked doors, no encrypted files with ominous names, and no meetings after the meeting. It’s exactly what it looks like: a software meeting. Nothing more. If you think otherwise, well, that’s entirely on you.
